{"name":"Laraedit","tagline":"An IDE package for Laravel","body":"# LaraEdit\r\nAn IDE package for Laravel. \r\n\r\nI started building LaraEdit around October of 2014 and was able to package a working code editor and terminal emulator for Laravel 4 rather quickly (https://github.com/iBourgeois/LaraEdit). However, shortly after gaining traction I wanted to upgrade the package to work on Laravel 5 which was to be released soon there after.\r\n\r\nAfter several delays in the release of L5, I was forced to sideline the project momentarily. \r\n\r\nNow I am back! And I have brought with me, a new set of blueprints for what I would like to accomplish with LaraEdit. Though it will require two separate packages, I think you'll enjoy the outcome in the event I succeed...\r\n\r\nI hate to leave you hanging like this, but there will be more to come soon!\r\n\r\n# Installation (Standalone)\r\n- Add the LaraEdit package to your composer requirements:\r\n  ``` \"laraedit/laraedit\": \"dev-master\", ```\r\n- Add the LaraEdit Service hook to your app config:\r\n  ``` \"LaraEdit\\LaraEdit\\LaraEditServiceProvider\" ```\r\n- Publish the LaraEdit assets using Artisan:\r\n  ``` php artisan vendor:publish ```\r\n- Visit the route:\r\n  ``` /laraedit ```\r\n- Enjoy!\r\n\r\n# Installation (With LaraGit)\r\n- Add the LaraEdit package to your composer requirements:\r\n  ``` \"laraedit/laraedit\": \"dev-master\", ```\r\n- Add the LaraEdit Service hook to your app config:\r\n  ``` \"LaraEdit\\LaraEdit\\LaraGitServiceProvider\" ```\r\n- Publish the LaraEdit assets using Artisan:\r\n  ``` php artisan vendor:publish ```\r\n- Visit the route:\r\n  ``` /laraedit ```\r\n- Enjoy!\r\n\r\n# The Plan\r\n\r\n#### Phase One\r\n  \r\n  - LaraEdit will provide a working code editor.\r\n  \r\n#### Phase Two\r\n\r\n  - LaraEdit will provide a working terminal emulator to accompany the code editor.\r\n\r\n#### Phase Three\r\n\r\n  - LaraEdit will gain the ability to interface with LaraGit (https://github.com/LaraEdit/LaraGit).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
